# This file controls the activity of snmptrapd

# snmptrapd control (yes means start daemon).  As of net-snmp version
# 5.0, master agentx support must be enabled in snmpd before snmptrapd
# can be run.  See snmpd.conf(5) for how to do this.

# Hardcoded to yes so that we can use proper service management to enable/disable this using puppet
